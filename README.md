<!-- NOTE(BK): Avoiding a reference to the TR that get out of date quickly -->

## Contents of this project

The FS_Beyond2D study is concerned with multiple Beyond 2D representations and service scenarios.
This project contains scripts and configuration files for the reproducible evaluation of those
scenarios. Source sequences, bitstreams and rendered out pose trace videos are available on
different servers, as written in the TR.

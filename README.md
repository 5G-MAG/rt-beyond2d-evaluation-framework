# Introduction

This project provides the evaluation framework for the *Feasibility Study on Beyond 2D Video*
(FS_Beyond2D) in [3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org) TSG SA
[WG4](https://www.3gpp.org/3gpp-groups/service-system-aspects-sa/sa-wg4) (SA4).
This study is based on work item description (WID)
[SP-240479](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/TSG_SA/TSGS_103_Maastricht_2024-03/Docs/SP-240479.zip)
*New SID on Feasibility Study on Beyond 2D Video*, and the study will result in technical report [TR 26.956](https://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/26956.htm).

## Contents of this project

The FS_Beyond2D study is concerned with multiple Beyond 2D representations and service scenarios.
This project contains scripts and configuration files for the reproducible evaluation of those
scenarios. Source sequences, bitstreams and rendered out pose trace videos are available on
different servers, as written in the TR.

### Scenario 1: UE-to-UE Stereoscopic Video Live Streaming
